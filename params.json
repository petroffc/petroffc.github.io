{"name":"Christopher Petroff","tagline":"cpetroff.net","body":"# About Me #####\r\n\r\nOriginally from Connecticut, I am currently a senior at [Boston College](http://www.bc.edu/) majoring in chemistry and minoring in math. Much of my time is spent in the chemistry lab researching metal-organic frameworks for Professor [Frank Tsung](https://www2.bc.edu/frank-tsung/). Besides chemistry, I have interests in nature/ecology, hiking, camping, and photography.\r\n\r\n# ACS Student Chapter of Boston College #####\r\n\r\nDuring the summer of 2014, a few friends and I restarted the ACS Student Chapter on campus. While a chemistry club has existed on campus since 1926 and been recognized by ACS since 1947, the club had not been active for nearly a decade. Our goal is to build a better sense of community among chemistry majors and create a low-key environment where they can gather in a non-academic setting. Currently, I serve as the chapter's Vice President and Webmaster. For more information, please visit the chapter's website: [bc.chem.club](http://bc.chem.club/).\r\n\r\n# Camp Workcoeman #####\r\n\r\nI have worked at Camp Workcoeman, a Boy Scout camp in New Hartford, Connecticut, every summer since 2008. I worked in the Nature Lodge for my first four summers and have been the director of the Tenderfoot's Compass program since 2012. The Tenderfoot's Compass is a program for first year Scouts to work together as a patrol and learn many of the skills they need to achieve the ranks on Tenderfoot, Second Class, and First Class. Camp has a special place in my heart and is where I have made many of my best friends. For more information, please visit the camp's website: [campworkcoeman.org](http://campworkcoeman.org/).\r\n\r\n# Cedar Strip Canoe #####\r\n\r\nIn the spring of my senior year of high school at [Taft](http://www.taftschool.org/), I built a cedar strip canoe as my senior project. The canoe is made out of thin strips of cedar glued together and covered with a fiberglass and epoxy sheath.\r\n\r\n![Steaming hardwood strips for the bow/stern](http://www.cpetroff.net/images/image3.JPG)\r\n![Hardwood strips bent over bow form](http://www.cpetroff.net/images/image5.JPG)\r\n![Preparing to glue the bow/stern](http://www.cpetroff.net/images/image8.JPG)\r\n![Glued bow strips](http://www.cpetroff.net/images/image9.JPG)\r\n![Cut cedar strips](http://www.cpetroff.net/images/image12.JPG)\r\n![Canoe molds on strongback](http://www.cpetroff.net/images/image14.JPG)\r\n![Planking the canoe](http://www.cpetroff.net/images/image16.JPG)","google":"UA-39152188-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
